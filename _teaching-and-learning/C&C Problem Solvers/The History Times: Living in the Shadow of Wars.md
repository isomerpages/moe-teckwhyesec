The History Times: Living in the Shadow of Wars: Virtual Presentation by Teck Whyeans to the Knowledge Building International Community
=======================================================================================================================================

Historians are curators who capture, connect and construct stories of the past. Over the past few months, students from Clementi Town Secondary School (CTSS) and Teck Whye Secondary School (TWSS) came together to build knowledge on the big idea of War. After engaging in a series of collaborative activities and performance tasks, the students worked together in conceptualizing, designing, and creating a set of history newsletters related to the theme on War.

On 22nd March 2022, the Knowledge Building Networked Learning Community brought together over 80 teachers, students, researchers and experts from all over the world to learn, inquire and deepen their collective understanding on wars. Co-presenting with their peers from CTSS, their joint concurrent sharing sessions got the participants to be fully engaged, enriched, and empowered with regards to their level of historical literacy, consciousness, and discourse.  

Building upon these meaningful experiences, the students are now guiding and leading the next batch of Teck Whyeans in the 2nd cross-school collaboration.
