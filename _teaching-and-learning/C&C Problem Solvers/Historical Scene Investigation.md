Historical Scene Investigation
==============================

<img src="/images/hsi1.jpg" style="width:55%">

The Historical Scene Investigation Challenge allows students to put their historical inquiry and research skills to the test. This year’s edition of the challenge required students to produce a video of their findings and a 500 word research paper. Our students were drawn to find out more about the last tiger that was killed in Chua Chu Kang in 1930 and embarked on the project titled – Changing Landscapes of Singapore: From Natural Vegetation to a Prosperous plantation ground – The Story of Neo Tiew, examining how changes made to the natural environment in Lim Chu Kang by Neo Tiew impacted the people in Singapore. Through weeks of hard work of looking for and examining many sources, the team comprising Noor Na’ila Yasamin Binte Nazri (1A), Ong Kai An Sam (1D), Chan Li Ying (2A) and Chia Kai Wen (2B) was awarded a Silver Award!
