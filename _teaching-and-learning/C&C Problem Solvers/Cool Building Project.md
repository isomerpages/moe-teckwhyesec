Cool Building Project
=====================

From 8 February 2021 to 17 February 2021, our Secondary Two students tried their hands at constructing a model building that could withstand the intense solar heat in tropical Singapore. They worked in teams and applied their Design Thinking skills to empathise with building occupants and generated several ideas during the brainstorming phase. Having learnt about the effects of heat and its transmission, our students bravely took on the challenge to apply what they learnt in class and designed a model building that could best keep its occupants cool without resorting to energy-intensive cooling measures.

Our students had the opportunity to test their designs under the midday sun over two days during their Science lessons. Using an infrared thermometer, they recorded the temperature of a small metal cube (representing a human) inside their building over a duration of five minutes. Ideally, the cube’s temperature should not rise substantially.

The students enjoyed recording the temperatures and excitedly compared their results online. Several adjustments were made to the design of their buildings to reduce the heat gain and they improved their earlier results.  The enthusiasm and excitement was clearly palpable. During the next Science lesson, the teams presented their findings to the class and shared which of their building’s features had significantly helped to reduce the cube’s temperature. A thoroughly authentic learning experience indeed!
