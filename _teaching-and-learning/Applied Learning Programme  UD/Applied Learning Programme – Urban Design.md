Applied Learning Programme – Urban Design
=========================================


<img src="/images/ud1.jpg" style="width:75%">

The school’s Applied Learning Programme in Urban Design is aimed at raising awareness among students about issues related to urbanisation, and develop their problem-solving, critical thinking and collaborative learning skills as they design sustainable solutions to real world issues and problems.

Students are introduced to the Design Thinking approach and draw upon knowledge gained in and out of the classroom to design sustainable solutions in the areas of Urban Farming, Transportation, Energy and Smart Living.

A whole-school approach ensures that Secondary 1-3 students are engaged in meaningful and purposeful collaborative learning activities so as to nurture a community of future-ready learners and design thinkers. It is hoped that through this programme, our students will become self-directed and collaborative and creative problem solvers, preparing them for work and life.
