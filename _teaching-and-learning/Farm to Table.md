From Farm to Table!
===================

Rain certainly did not deter our budding Urban Farmers. Armed with umbrellas, students from 1E harvested the vegetables they grew themselves in the Design and Research Space of Urban Farming (DRSUF) and put them to good use, frying up plates of mouth-watering _Mee Goreng_.

Collaboratively, our Food & Consumer Education (FCE) teachers of 1E came up with the idea of incorporating the students’ harvest into their lesson. With the harvested _Chye Sim_, our FCE teachers taught them how to whip up a delicious and healthier version of _Mee Goreng_.

With close guidance from their FCE teachers, the students learnt about which ingredients to fry first so that the crunchiness and freshness of their vegetables could be preserved.

Such collaboration makes learning meaningful for our students. From planting the seedling, harvesting, to finally cooking the vegetables as part of their culinary creation, our students learn through the entire experience. Of course, a tasty plate of _Mee Goreng_ for lunch is an added bonus!
