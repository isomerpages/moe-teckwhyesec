Orchid Hybridisation Programme (Biology)
========================================

The Orchid Hybridisation Programme is a series of meticulously-planned workshops where students learn about the physiology and anatomy of an orchid plant and the process of orchid hybridisation. This provided a unique real-world context for learning relevant topics in the Pure Biology and Science (Biology) syllabi.

As part of the school’s 50th anniversary celebrations in 2016, students successfully cultivated a hybrid named _Dendrobium TWSS50_. You can read about it [here](https://www.facebook.com/todayonline/posts/for-some-students-of-teck-whye-secondary-schools-orchid-hybridisation-programme-/10154577337117572/).

In 2018, the school helped in the production of a documentary titled ‘The Wish’ where students in the programme helped to fulfil the wish of a physically challenged elderly man, Mr Tan Hong Lian, by teaching him the intricate process of orchid hybridisation. He was then presented with an orchid hybrid – _Dendrobium Tan Hong Lian_ named after him. You can catch the video [here](https://www.mewatch.sg/watch/The-Wish-E1-The-Oasis-147898).

In recent years, the school has expanded its programme and developed the Design and Research Space for Orchid Hybridisation where students can carry out the hybridisation process under laboratory conditions and try their hands at creating new orchid hybrids.
