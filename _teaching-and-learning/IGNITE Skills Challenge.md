IGNITE Skills Challenge
=======================

Organised by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), the IgnITE Skills Challenge is an annual competition that introduces students to technical skills and fosters a deeper understanding of courses offered by ITE. Challenges are designed to be engaging and fun so as to make learning enjoyable and memorable.

Students from Secondary 3G attended online workshops conducted by the ITE lecturers and put their skills to the test by taking part in the Filtraxxion Challenge where they constructed a filtration system using natural materials. In addition, they also learnt to create, set up and optimise a messenger bot to converse with other learners!

The key takeaway the students appreciated was the opportunity to learn something new in an engaging manner. As they worked on their challenge together, they also picked up important socio-emotional competencies like relationship and self-management skills.
