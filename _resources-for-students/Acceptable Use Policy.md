===========================

**For Personal Learning Device & School ICT Resources**

Dear Student,

Computing devices and access to the Internet have become a necessity for work, play and learning in the 21st century. As you navigate the digital space, you should do so in a safe and responsible manner.

In addition, you are reminded to observe the guidelines stated in this Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) on the use of personal learning devices (PLDs) and the school’s ICT resources.
