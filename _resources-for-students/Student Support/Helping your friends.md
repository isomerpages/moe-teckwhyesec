Helping your friends
====================

Are you feeling stressed? Whether it’s adapting to student life, exams, or emotional disconnect, life can be stressful, but you are not alone. Some students may benefit from the support and empathy of a peer. Some of them may find it easy to connect with a peer who is at a similar life stage and who may be experiencing similar life challenges.

**Ways to show support to your friend:**

1.  Be **regular**: Check in with them at least twice a week to find out how they are doing.
2.  Be **present**: Share more about yourself and also spend time listening to what your buddy has to share
3.  Show **empathy**: Take some time and think – “If I’m in the same situation as my friend, how would I feel?”
4.  Be **respectful**: You may not agree with your friend, but do not be too quick to judge

**Look out for these signs and alert your teacher if you** **are worried about your friend:**
