Applied Learning Programme: Design & Research Space for Urban Farming
=====================================================================

In Teck Whye Secondary school, students learn how to relate Science meaningfully to daily life and understand how Science contributes to the society. In our Design and Research Space of Urban Farming (DRSUF), students enjoy planting and harvesting vegetables such as Milk Cabbage, (_Nai Bai_ 奶白) and Romaine Lettuce. Herbs like mint and basil are also planted in the shade house.

Such a programme hopes to instil in students the need for sustainable urban farming in view of Singapore’s limited natural resources. As Singapore works towards reducing its reliance on food imports and building up buffers during supply chain disruptions, urban farming is an emerging new industry. Giving our students an exposure to urban farming helps them to learn about Science concepts such as ‘Transport in Plants’ as well as a sustainable eco-system in an authentic and practical setting.

The plants are grown using the hydroponics and aquaponics system installed in the shade house. The Science Department hopes to give students the experience of a full crop rotation, where they will be involved in the planting, germination and harvesting of various vegetables. As the project continues to expand, there are also plans to engage the neighbourhood by planting and growing crops that the community needs.

The students look forward to each harvest cycle and enjoy seeing their hard work pay off. Weighing in at an impressive 14kg, the first harvest of Milk Cabbage was encouraging and inspired them to put in more work to plant and harvest a larger crop of Romaine Lettuce. During each harvest, students and staff bring home the vegetables to share with their families and one cannot help but notice how fresh and tasty they look!
