Together Our Singapore Spirit
=============================

“Together Our Singapore Spirit” was a very apt theme for the 2021 National Day Celebrations. Despite the safe management measures, our TWSS Family and ‘can-do’ spirit helped to make the 2021 National Day Celebrations meaningful and memorable for students and staff. From coordinating the live broadcast to organising interactive segments, our teachers kept students engaged and in a lively celebratory mood. Class Leaders were also on hand to lead their classes in the games and quiz segments, generating much fun and laughter.

The Secondary Three students also received their NRICs in a virtual ceremony from their Form Teachers. This was a significant moment for them as it marked a key milestone in their citizenship journey. It was also a proud moment for some of their Form Teachers as they reminisced the time their students were still Secondary Ones entering secondary school for the first time and how far they have come since.

To get into the theme of National Day, the students also participated virtually in conversations about national issues and ended off the celebrations with the highly engaging National Day dance segment. A highlightof the celebrations was the school’s very own fun pack which featured products from famous local heritage brands (Khong Guan Biscuits, Old Chang Kee, Yeo’s, NTUC and Sunshine Bakery). Students got to discuss about our local heritage and took pride in learning how our local brands have built their reputations, extending beyond our borders to become internationally renowned too!
