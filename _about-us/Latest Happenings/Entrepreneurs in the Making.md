Entrepreneurs-in-the-Making!
============================

As part of their Elements of Business Skill (EBS) lessons, 3G students learnt about effective marketing techniques and set up a small ‘minimart’ in the canteen to put their knowledge to practice. Together with the help of their EBS teacher, Mr Chai Jun Yang, the students brainstormed on what products to sell and through some marketing surveys, narrowed down the items for sale. Students also used this chance to test out pricing techniques to boost sales which made learning authentic.

It was heartening to see that as they sold their products, the students were also thinking of ways to better improve their operations and discussed using some of their Computer Applications (CPA) knowledge to use Excel formulas to key in transactions in the future to save time. As the products moved, they were also very excited to see that their marketing hunches proved accurate.

Their first foray into entrepreneurship was a success -they sold most of their stock in minutes!
