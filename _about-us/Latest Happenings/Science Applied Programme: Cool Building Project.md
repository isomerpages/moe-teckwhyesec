Cool Building Project
=====================

From 8 February 2021 to 17 February 2021, our Secondary Two students tried their hands at constructing a model building that could withstand the intense solar heat in tropical Singapore. They worked in teams and applied their Design Thinking skills to empathise with building occupants and generated several ideas during the brainstorming phase. Having learnt about the effects of heat and its transmission, our students bravely took on the challenge to apply what they learnt in class and designed a model building that could best keep its occupants cool without resorting to energy-intensive cooling measures.
