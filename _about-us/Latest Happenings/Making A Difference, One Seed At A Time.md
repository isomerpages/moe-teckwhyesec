With safe management measures in place, it can be challenging to organise traditional VIA activities for students. This did not deter the students from the Concert Band CCA who decided to come up with a creative way to help the community.

Having gone through urban farming activities at the school’s Design & Research Space for Urban Farming (DRSUF) and learning about the importance of balanced nutrition through their Food and Consumer Education (FCE) lessons, the students decided to grow and harvest a batch of _Bok Choy_ vegetables for the neighbourhood’s community fridge. This would benefit needy residents, giving them ready access to fresh vegetables to have more nutritious meals.

Working together to plant and nurture their seedlings, the students produced a healthy batch of vegetables which were then packed and delivered to the community fridge. While the students enjoyed themselves, the most important lesson they learnt was that every little good deed helps to make a difference, even if it is one seed at a time!
