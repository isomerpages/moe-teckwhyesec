Pongal Celebrations with CCK CC IAEC
====================================

**_Pongal_ Celebrations with CCK CC IAEC (Choa Chu Kang Community Centre Indian Activity Executive Committee)**

On 30 January 2021, Tamil language students from Teck Whye Secondary school and its Tamil Centre joined Choa Chu Kang residents to celebrate _Pongal_ virtually with Health Minister Mr Gan Kim Yong. From the preparation of the traditional _Pongal_ dish to the hands-on craft activities, the students were able to interact with Minister Gan, who joined them via Zoom to observe the _thoranam_ making, diorama making and _pongal_ pot painting activities.

Organised by the school’s Mother Tongue Department (Tamil Unit) and the CCK IAEC, the event was supported by alumni and Tamil teachers from the West Zone primary and secondary schools who facilitated different learning activities for the students. It was certainly heart-warming to find out that one of the teachers, Mr Satheeswaran, from West Spring Primary School, was from Teck Whye Secondary School’s Class of 2007!

Not wanting to break the tradition of celebrating _Pongal_ as a community due to Covid-19 restrictions, the school and the CCK CC IAEC worked together to live-stream the activities, allowing students, teachers and residents of different ethnicities and religions to learn and appreciate _Pongal_ together, reflecting Singapore’s diverse and multicultural background.

The event was off to an auspicious start as our principal, Mr Siva lit the oil lamp and observed the overflowing of the fragrant _Pongal_ mixture. As the _Pongal_ dish boiled over, signalling the blessing of abundance, the audience was treated to a dance performance and was able to observe, together with Minister Gan and the residents, the learning activities going on for students. As they painted _Pongal_ pots, made _thoranam_ and showcased art pieces made from nine different grain types (_navathaniam_), the students enjoyed themselves as they learnt about each activity’s significance and shared their knowledge with the school leaders who visited the different learning venues. After Mr Siva gave his closing address, students and teachers ended the morning on a sweet note with a delicious portion of pongal rice and an _idly_ and _vadai_ bento set. _Pongalo Pongal_!
