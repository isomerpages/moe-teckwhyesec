A Journey of Discovery!
=======================

The inaugural Discovery Week 2021 was carried out from 10 March to 12 March. The 3 days were filled with enthusiasm and excitement as students from Secondary One to Five engaged in the various learning experiences that were designed to build their character and social-emotional well-being.

The design and enactment of these learning experiences were undergirded by 3 guiding principles – student-centricity, intentionality and coherence. Discovery Week 2021 aimed to enhance students’ quality of school experience, cultivate positive relationships and develop their social emotional competencies. 

Be it the outdoor adventure learning, the ALP design challenge, the sports experience, interview skills or social etiquette workshops, students gamely participated in them, deriving much amusement and positivity.

They learnt to be aware of themselves and the people around them, manage themselves and others and to make responsible decisions as they navigate through life’s challenges. They even had fun having lunch and ice-cream with their form teachers. It was definitely a school experience that they will keep close to their hearts and talk about fondly for many years to come.
