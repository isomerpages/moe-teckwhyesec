Celebrating Our Teachers
========================

**_One child, one teacher, one book, one pen, can change the world – Malala Yousafzai_**

Today our students showed their teachers how much they appreciate them with notes of thanks and hand-made gifts. Although the celebrations were virtual, the student leaders created a lively atmosphere through the Kahoot! Quizzes about their Form and Subject Teachers. Appreciation dances, songs and a piano recital by student performers were also broadcast for every class to enjoy.

A special pizza treat (in individual portions) was also the highlight for the students and teachers. Whilst keeping in line with safe management measures, teachers and their classes had their class-based celebrations. As the celebrations drew to a close, class leaders presented their Form Teachers with a collection of handwritten notes from their students. A truly heart-warming end to a hectic term! Happy Teacher’s Day!
