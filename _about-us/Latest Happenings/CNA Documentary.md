Lights, Camera, Action!
=======================

Barely a few days ago, most countries, including Singapore, marked the first year since the outbreak of Covid-19. In a year, so many daily activities we took for granted changed in the blink of an eye – including learning. Almost overnight, teachers had to rethink the way they taught traditionally had to move from being ‘the sage on the stage’ to ‘the guide by the side’, helping to facilitate online learning for their students.

Exploring how Covid-19 changed how things are done and sped up change in other sectors, Channel News Asia came down and interacted with some of our teachers, getting insights on their thoughts.

Mdm Pua Lee Too, who teaches Geography, said that she was initially worried about the change and realised that there was so much to learn in conducting online lessons. Her fellow colleague, Mdm Theophilia Yong, also a Geography Teacher, said that those who exhibited strong digital competencies worked alongside educators who were more hesitant, to explore ways to leverage technology for learning. Our Principal, Mr N Sivarajan, was of the view that learning could not go completely online or virtual, as it was important for teachers to have face-to-face interaction and give feedback to their students.

Find out how the school made the transition from sage to guide! We hope you will enjoy the documentary on the [Channel News Asia website](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/video-on-demand/our-new-normal/our-new-normal-14515576). Our school is featured in the segment from 24:00 to 28:30.
