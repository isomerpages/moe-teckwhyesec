Steering your Success: Joven Goh (Class of 4A, 2018)
====================================================

If not for his decision to make sacrifices for the goals he wanted to achieve, Joven Goh (Class of 2018) may not have reaped the fruits of academic success. Having scored 6 As for his GCE A Level examinations in Jurong Pioneer Junior College, he has his heart set for medical school.

During his time in TWSS, Joven feels fortunate that he had a nurturing and supportive environment from his classmates and his teachers, which allowed him to build up success at his own pace. He credits his Lower Secondary Form Teacher at the time, Mr Tan Peng Yen, who built up his character and forged the value of hard work and resilience in him. His Science teachers over his four years in the school also fuelled his passion for Biology and Chemistry, planting the seeds of a career medicine in his mind.

When Joven was clear about the academic success he wanted to achieve, he made the decision to completely give up gaming. It was not easy and he gradually cut it off, hour by hour. After he had done so, he realised he now had an additional five or six hours of spare time he could devote to his studies. In fact, he rarely picks up his games any more, preferring to work on more fulfilling things.

This is where his 80-20 rule comes in. Joven feels that students have to put in 80% of the work themselves. While teachers provide guidance, morale building and motivation, if students do not budge and put what the teachers give them to work for their goals, it would be challenging for them to taste success. The responsibility, he feels, is on students to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve their goals. This served him well in junior college where the workload was heavy but fulfilling.

Jovenâ€™s advice to his juniors in TWSS is to put in the discipline if you want to reap the rewards. Besides making sacrifices to give up distractions, he suggests making use of school experiences like CCAs to build up resilience and discipline. An avid basketballer, he credits the physical drills with helping him to stay focused and disciplined. He feels that if students can apply discipline to pursuits they enjoy in CCA, they should try to apply it to their studies as well.
