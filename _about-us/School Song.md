Now in our days of joyous youth  
We Will strive in earnest search  
For wondrous gleams of truth and light

Like pioneers we’ll set the pace  
For all who dare to follow close  
Uphold the codes of our national life

Readied for the calls of home and state  
We’ll give forever our best to both  
We’ll freely give what we have learned  
Within the walls of Teck Whye
