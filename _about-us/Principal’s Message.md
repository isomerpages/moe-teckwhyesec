Principal’s Message
===================

<img src="/images/p1.jpg" style="width:220px;height:260px;margin-right:25px;" align = "left"> **Welcome to the Teck Whye Secondary School website!**

Established in 1966, just after Singapore’s independence, the school has a proud tradition of providing a nurturing environment through the changing phases of education; helping students from all backgrounds maximise their potential and prepare for post-secondary education.

**Mission – Inspiring Learning, Empowering Lives**  
As the nation enters into a new phase in education – Learn for Life movement, the school too aims to **inspire learning** beyond books and examinations, and to cultivate in students the mindsets and learning dispositions needed for a lifetime of learning. This will be crucial in **empowering** students to live happy and purposeful lives in a fast changing world, further accelerated by technological advancements and other disruptions (eg.COVID-19).

**Vision – A Community of Future-Ready Learners**  
In order to prepare students to be future-ready, the school aims to cultivate in students the **5 Minds of The Future** (Disciplined Mind, Creative Mind, Synthesising Mind, Respectful Mind, Ethical Mind) postulated by Howard Gardner. Teaching & learning practices and student development programmes at the school are intended to develop students to become **Self-Directed Learners,** **Collaborative Problem-Solvers,** **Resilient Persons &** **Global Citizens.**

I invite you to explore the website to get a glimpse of the engaging learning experiences that we offer at the school.

Principal, Teck Whye Secondary School
