School History
==============

**Our Initial Years (1966 – 1979)**

Following Singapore’s independence in 1965, the nation was faced with the immediate need to address its economic survival. As a result, education became survival-driven. National integration was also seen as a key condition for economic survival and bilingualism inevitably became a key component in Singapore’s education system. This would lead to the creation of integrated schools which would offer education in English and Mother Tongue. At the same time, there was also a higher demand for secondary school places due to the growth of Singapore’s population.

In this landscape, Jalan Teck Whye Secondary School was the second integrated school to be established in the Teck Whye neighbourhood and provided education in English, Mandarin and Malay. It was officially opened on 11 September 1967 by then Minister for Education Ong Pang Boon and Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Tang See Chim, signalling the synergistic partnership between education and economic development.

During this period of humble beginnings, the school worked on building its identity and progressively built up its Extra Curricular Activities (ECA) to encourage integration amongst students from the different races and streams. Concurrently the school also improved its infrastructure to create a more conducive learning environment for students.

**Our Pioneering Years (1980 – 2001)**

By the end of the 1970s, Singapore’s stellar economic progress signalled a need for the nation to transit from a labour-intensive to a capital-intensive economy. Efficiency-driven education in the form of a national curriculum with a stress on bilingualism, civics and moral education as well as an emphasis on science, mathematics and technical education was unveiled.

Renamed to Teck Whye Secondary School in 1980, the school responded to the change by encouraging staff development and promoting computer literacy. Programmes put in place to promote bilingualism and ECAs continued to provide a good platform for the integration of students from different racial groups. The school also improved its infrastructure to enhance the learning experience of its students.

In addition, the school strongly believed in bringing out its students’ greatest potential so that they would grow up into good and useful citizens. Embarking on a two-pronged approach of community-oriented self-development to inculcate values in young Teck Whyeans, the school was also able to leverage on its dedicated staff to also help its more challenging students return to a more purposeful path.

**Our Transformative Years (2002 – 2016)**

With the advent of the “Thinking Schools Learning Nation” ability-driven education model to help Singapore transition towards a knowledge-based economy in 1997, there was greater flexibility and choice offered to students. Streams were no longer rigid barriers and schools were given the flexibility to offer options that matched student interests. Schools were strongly encouraged to take ownership of the curriculum and co-curricular activities to better respond to student talents and abilities and to customise their programmes to meet student aptitudes and skills.

In 2002, Teck Whye moved into its new premises at Teck Whye Crescent. With a larger campus and better facilities, the school was ready to step up to the challenge of responding to the demands of providing an ability-driven education to its students. To herald this new chapter in the history of the school, the school mission, vision, uniform, school crest and colours were changed. Teck Whye’s transformative years are an exciting period where students benefitted from the school’s commitment to make available a plethora of opportunities to develop them holistically.

Curriculum innovation was encouraged with departments offering talent development programmes which allowed students to appreciate learning and challenge themselves to excel.

In 2011, the Student-Centric Values-Driven Education initiative was launched to better deliver a holistic and values-driven education and comprised of key programmes and activities to instil deep values in students, build deep foundations for learning, provide broad, inclusive and holistic education and encourage learning for life. Many initiatives were launched by the school to meet these outcomes and students benefited from programmes that aimed to develop them in the physical, cognitive, aesthetic, social-moral and leadership domains.

Niche areas were also built up to attract talent to the school and students were exposed to learning platforms that developed them holistically and inculcated lifelong learning.  To ensure that students would develop deep values, even stronger community bonds were built through the introduction of a community-based Values in Action programme where students partnered the community to reach out to residents in need.

With the seeds planted by pioneering educators and the flowers lovingly cared for by subsequent generations, Teck Whye will continue to bloom with pride for many years to come.
