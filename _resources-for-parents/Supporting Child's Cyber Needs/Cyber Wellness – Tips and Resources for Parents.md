Cyber Wellness– Tips and Resources for Parents
==============================================

Our children today belong to a “linkster” generation who are constantly connected. The open nature of the internet poses a danger to our children as it can expose them to undesirable content which may corrupt their value systems, and to unnecessary hurts.

As such, we feel that Cyber Wellness education is important as it supports the positive well-being of our students as they navigate the cyberspace. We would also like to refer you to MOE’s Cyber Wellness resources for parents: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/programmes/cyber-wellness](https://www.moe.gov.sg/programmes/cyber-wellness)

We present the **Cyber Wellness (CW) Connect** resources on **“Online Discernment”.**
