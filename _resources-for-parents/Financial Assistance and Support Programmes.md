Financial Assistance and Support Programmes
===========================================

The objective of the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) is to help needy Singaporean students to meet their basic schooling expenses. These schemes are funded by MOE and/or the school.

**MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)**

The Ministry of Education provides financial assistance to needy Singapore Citizen students in Government or Government-Aided Schools. The income limits and type of assistance given to needy students are provided in the pamphlet and application form:

[MOE FAS Pamphlet 2022](/files/MOE_FAS_Pamphlet_2022.pdf)
[MOE FAS Application form     ](/files/MOE-FAS-Application-Form-Sep-21.pdf) 

Detailed information about household income requirements/financial assistance eligibility can be found at the [MOE Financial Assistance Page](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance).

If you have children in different government or government-aided schools, you can submit 1 application form to any of the schools.

**School-Based Financial Assistance Scheme**

MOE-FAS applicants who are not successful in their applications may be considered for the School-Based Financial Assistance Scheme.  The type of assistance provided is based on a case-by-case needs-basis and the availability of funding.

**Other Forms of Financial Assistance**

Students who do not meet the income eligibility criteria but are in need of financial assistance may e-mail the school at [twss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:twss@moe.edu.sg) or approach the staff at the General Office for advice on other financial assistance schemes.
