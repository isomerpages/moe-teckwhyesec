The TWSS PSG is a bonding and communication platform that foster closer ties between TWSS parents, students and the school. Through this platform, we hope to promote more interaction, sharing and learning, in the process developing closer and more meaningful relationships with your teenage child.

1\.  PSG provides a support network among parents to learn and share best practices in working with and supporting their children in the learning and growing process.<br>
2\.  PSG volunteers may help enhance effectiveness of school events and programmes in areas such as funding (donations), manpower (chaperon), and expertise (sharing).<br>
3\.  PSG volunteers contribute to school effectiveness through constructive inputs in terms of planning and operations, via mechanisms such as surveys, feedback (verbal, written), and participating in committees.
