Termly weighted assessments are conducted to gauge the learning progress of students. End-of-year examinations will be conducted at the end of Semester Two for Secondary 1 to 3 students. Preliminary Examinations will be conducted in the third term for students who are taking the GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Level Examinations.

Performance for termly and end-of-year assessments will determine students’ promotion to the next level of study, lateral transfers across streams or retention at the same level of study. For Secondary Two, the results of the assessment are also used in the allocation of subjects during the subject options exercise.  

For the graduating cohort, the Preliminary Examination constitutes 100%. Milestone assessments (non-weighted assessments) are conducted to ensure consistent effort and consolidation of learning leading up to the Preliminary Examination.
