School Assessment Policy
========================

School-based assessment comprises of Weighted Assessment (WA) and Non-Weighted Assessment (NWA) components. Weighted Assessments count towards the computation of the final grade attained by a student for the academic year, while Non-Weighted Assessments do not. Together they form part of a balanced assessment system to nurture self-directed and life-long learners.

**Assessment Weighting (Secondary 4 & 5)**

Milestone Assessments (non-weighted) are conducted for the graduating cohort (Sec 4 & 5) to ensure that students put in consistent effort and consolidate their learning, leading up to the Preliminary Examinations (100% â€“ weighted)
