### About us

Teck Whye Dance aims to provide dancers with the opportunities to appreciate, create, present and respond to the different genres of dance. The dance programme gives exposure to students in dance genres like ethnic and international dance through a modular system.

Dancers are involved in discussing and relating to the values of the respective art forms and how they apply in their lives and also societies across cultures. As part of confidence building, the dancers also apply the skills, techniques and processes in the creation of their dances, while showcasing their skills through dance presentation and performances to different types of audiences.

Teck Whye Dance is where dancers learn, grow and excel as one troupe building perseverance and unity in line with the school values.
