### About us

The CCA started its illustrious career as a military band in 1966 but made a bold millennial switch to a Concert Band in 2003, in-line with the band’s new motto, **‘_Unique and Versatile_**. 

Adopting a new motto propelled the uniquely versatile band from the fields to the concert stage with an intrepid spirit for excellence in both performance standards as well as motivation levels, holding true to our quest for excellence.

Participation in various public concerts has proven that the band members are multi-talented as they are able to put up a good performance with music from a wide-ranging repertoire for its audience, which includes people from all walks of life Such experiences also allow the students to acquire new skills like stage, technical, communication and people management skills.     

The invitation to perform on Labour Day on 1st May 2015 at the Istana for the public  was a major milestone for the band and recognition over the years has reaffirmed the band’s high performance standards.

The band continues to develop its members musically and provide various opportunities for music and leadership development while collaborating with the alumni to preserve the TWSS Concert Band heritage.
