### About us

TWSS Guitar Ensemble was formed in 2011 with less than 15 members. We took part in our first ever Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) in April 2011. With less than 3 months of training, our students displayed the spirit of resilience and excellence by clinching our first ever Bronze Award for SYF.

Since then, our ensemble has grown in number and are highly motivated and ambitious to be a proficient and respectable music community in TWSS. With the grit and desire to perform to the best of our abilities, the ensemble achieved a Certificate of Distinction in 2015. It was indeed a remarkable achievement for our students.

In order to expose our students to varied performing styles and provide an enriching learning journey, our students attend masterclasses and concerts on a regular basis.
