### About us

The Teck Whye Basketball Team is a competitive team which comprises of many passionate and determined basketball players. Our team trains hard twice a week to represent the school in various competitions such as the West Zone Basketball Championships and the Active SG-BAS Basketball Development League.

These competitions allow our team to be exposed to schools across the entire nation and through this, help the boys to gain valuable experience. Above all, these competitions help our team to develop on-court chemistry and forge stronger friendship and bonding between teammates.

During the ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division Boys West Zone Schools Basketball Championships, our boys have bravely fought against stronger teams and have come a long way since the team’s humble beginnings in 2012.

Aside from the West Zone Schools Basketball Championships, our team also arranges for friendly matches with different schools throughout the year.
