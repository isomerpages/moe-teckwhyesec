### About us

Wushu is derived from traditional Chinese martial art practices and blends elements of performance and martial arts. In competitive Wushu, athletes execute complex routines that can either be performed barehanded or with weapons. They are judged according to the quality of movements, coordination and strength.

Speed, strength and stamina are required to perform the routines well. Through the practice of Wushu, students strive to improve their physical abilities and mental strength. The students also learn to be resilient and exercise self-discipline to persevere through the tough physical training.
