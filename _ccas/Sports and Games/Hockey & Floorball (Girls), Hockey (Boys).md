### About us

The Teck Whye Hockey and Floorball Team has come a long way since it began in the early 2000s. Over the years, both the Girls’ and Boys’ teams have participated in numerous competitions and have clinched several titles in the National Schools Tournaments.

As testament to their skills, many Teck Whye hockey players have been selected to join the National Men and Womens’ Hockey Teams and have represented Singapore in several regional and international competitions.

All these achievements have been made possible by a team of dedicated teachers who work hard to uphold the high standards of hockey and sportsmanship in the team. In addition to normal training sessions, the players’ skills are also honed through exposure to inter-school and overseas friendlies.
