### About us

The mission of Netball is to nurture the character and leadership skills of the girls with a strong emphasis on resilience, teamwork and communication within the team through regular netball training and strategy planning sessions.

Netball is a sport that also pushes the girls beyond their perceived capabilities. It challenges both their mental strength and physical strength as they continuously seek to improve.Â
