### About us

Guiding in TWSS provides a safe platform and environment for students to explore new possibilities and achieve personal goals while making friends and having adventures.

Girl Guides offers a wide array of activities which aims to develop the girls to their fullest potential and inculcate in them values such as team spirit, perseverance, responsibility and integrity. We believe these are the ingredients in facilitating their journey to become responsible citizens of the world.

In Girl Guides, students are exposed to new skills in a fun environment. Girl Guides work together in Patrols. We elect our own Patrol Leaders and plan our own activities to ensure the total development of our girls.

**Mission**  
To enable young women to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world.

We are a growing worldwide Movement ~ the voice of girls and young women who influence issues they care about and build a better world. **The Guides’ Motto**–_**Be Prepared**_ shares the Founder’s initials and is a practical reminder of the educational purposes of Girl Guiding.

**The Guide Promise and Law**
The Promise and Law is the heart and soul of the Guide Movement. They are the fundamental principles of the Girl Guiding and every member should observe and live by them.

A Guide makes a personal commitment to these principles which in turn leads her to accept and to develop her responsibilities towards the community.

I promise to do my best:  
To do my duty to God,  
To serve my country and  
help other people, and  
To keep the Guide Law.
