**NCC Core Values**

**Loyalty To Country**

*   Loyalty to and love for country must be deeply ingrained in the hearts and minds of all cadets; these are imbued in the cadets by way of their commitment to serve the nation through maintenance of high discipline and training standards.

**Uprightness**

*   Exemplary conduct together with strong moral strength to differentiate right from wrong; honesty and truthfulness in carrying out duties with full responsibility.

**Leadership**

*   Role modelling and influencing fellow-cadets to aspire to their highest potential both academically and in NCC training and activities; leadership by example and through involvement with peers and subordinates.

**Discipline**

*   Timely execution of tasks that have to be done, even though they might be difficult and painful, and doing them to the best of one’s ability; self-discipline that produces mental and physical resilience and strength.

**Commitment & Responsibility**

*   Taking training seriously and aspiring to benefit optimally from the experiences; show of dedication and pride to the Corps.

**Care For Fellow Cadets**

*   Genuine concern for the well-being of fellow cadets during and outside training; this care and concern will facilitate esprit de corps and maintain a high level of morale and cohesiveness in the NCC.

**Adventurous Spirit**
