### About us

The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) was formed in 1959 and has grown from strength to strength to become one of the more popular uniformed youth organisations in Singapore.

The Corps has grown in number and substance. Its popularity amongst our youths is largely attributed to its stature as the only uniformed youth organisation to enjoy close affiliation with the Singapore Police Force.

Our cadets are exposed to the unique opportunities to gain exposure and familiarity with Singapore’s crime prevention efforts to build a safe and secure Home.

Through a myriad of activities, values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity and civic-consciousness are inculcated to develop them into caring and responsible citizens.

**Mission**

*   The mission of the National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our members to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.

**Vision**

*   The vision of the National Police Cadet Corps is to become the best youth organisation in Singapore, one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world.

In accordance with our mission and observing our objectives, we believe in

**Developing Leaders with Character & Values**

*   **ENSURE** our growth by exposing us to a challenging environment, which, in turn will imbibe us with leadership qualities, strong character and civic, social and moral values.
