### About us

The mission of the Art and Crafts Club is to allow members to appreciate and create various forms of art and provide opportunities and platforms where members are actively involved in art-creation and art critiques through teamwork, self-management, sharing of skills and creative ideas. Members experience learning outside of the classroom, during learning journeys to museums and art exhibitions, as well as outdoor sketching.Â
