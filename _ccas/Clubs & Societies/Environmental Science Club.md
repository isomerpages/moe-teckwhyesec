### About us

The Environmental Science Club aims to help its members, through “nurturing through nature”, to develop self-awareness and acquire life skills which enrich their well-being. Through opportunities to explore, create and innovate in playing their roles to save the earth, members will develop a sense of responsibility towards the environment. Working with their peers also help members to feel a sense of belonging through peer interaction and support.
