#### About us

The Teck Whye Secondary School Robotics Club is made up of students who want to have fun while learning about robotics. Club members begin their robotics journey with learning the basics of designing, building and programming robots before moving on to participate in robotics competitions.

Apart from preparing for competitions, members are also challenged to build robots that can take part in common activities that happen in the real world like robots that can participate in a robotic soccer match and robots that can transport items from one place to another.
