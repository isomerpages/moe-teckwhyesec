TWSS Overseas Learning Experience
=================================

The school’s Overseas Learning Experience ensures that Teck Whyeans get to travel at least once during their time in the school.

With trips organised to Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, it is hoped that students will get a chance, in this changing world climate, to learn about regionalisation and the importance it plays in helping Singapore stay relevant in the future.

As such, the Overseas Learning Experience acts as a first-step platform to introduce these countries to our students in the context of their role as emerging economies making inroads in the region and the world.

Our students are likely to venture to these countries in the future as part of Singapore’s opportunities to sustain growth. Having a chance to observe the country, interact with its people and learn from its history helps our students to adapt to unfamiliar surroundings and social situations, giving them a head start to hone their 21st century cross-cultural skills and competencies.

Being away from home and living for five days with their schoolmates and teachers also helps them to be independent, look out for each other, and gain confidence to step out of their comfort zones.
