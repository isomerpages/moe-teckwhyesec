==============================

<img src="/images/sld1.jpg" style="width:250px;height:250px;margin-right:25px;" align = "left">We provide various platforms to develop our Teck Whyeans to their full potential and nurture them to be confident role models who serve the community. Our Student Councillors, CCA leaders and class leaders work synergistically to support school-wide operations and programmes and promote school spirit, welfare and excellence among their peers.

### **Student Council**

The Student Council is the main student organisation of the school. The council focuses on supporting school wide operations and programmes, promoting school spirit and welfare and promoting school excellence. In order to facilitate the various aspects of school life, there are three distinct committee within the council, namely the Administrative Executive, School Support Services and Welfare & Project. The Students’ Council also takes charge of major events in the school calendar, such as the Youth Day’s Celebration, Teachers’ Day Celebration and Secondary One Orientation Programme.

### CCA Council

CCA Council comprises of the Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Leaders. The Council focuses on CCA management, building CCA spirit and promoting CCA excellence. Even though the CCA leaders manage their own areas of responsibilities, they share a common interest. They are passionate about their CCA, and are committed to inspire a shared vision among the seniors and juniors of their CCA. Besides managing their own CCA, the CCA Leaders also takes charge of major events in the school calendar, such as the All Student and Staff, Participate and EXercise (APEX) Day.

### Class Council

The Class Council comprises of the class leaders, namely the Class Chairpersons and Vice Chairpersons. The council focuses on class management, building class spirit and promoting class excellence. As the class leaders, they work very closely with the class committee and the form teachers to manage the discipline and welfare of the class. Beyond the classroom, the class leaders also work closely with the Student Council in managing major events in the school calendar, such as the Youth Day’s Celebration, Teachers’ Day Celebration and Secondary One Orientation Programme.
