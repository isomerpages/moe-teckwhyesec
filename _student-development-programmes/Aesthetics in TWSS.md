Aesthetics in TWSS
==================

**Our Mission**

Provide Opportunities and Nurture the Appreciation in the Arts

**Our Vision**

Arts for every Teck Whyean


<img src="/images/a1.png" style="width:100%">

As part of a holistic art education, the Aesthetic Department sets out to provide opportunities for our students to be exposed to all four different types of art forms, namely drama, art, music and dance through the curriculum and co-curriculum programmes.

 **Curriculum**

In our curriculum, students learn to appreciate, create and express themselves through music, art and drama.

**Art**

In art, students are exposed to new media like digital art and explore art appreciation collaboratively through knowledge building activities. They are able to appreciate art and analyse artworks critically through our Study of Visual Arts syllabus.

**Music**

In music, students without any music background are taught to play the keyboard. Through the music curriculum, they learn to appreciate local and international music and create their own musical compositions which are inspired by these musicians. Knowledge building is also a platform used in our songwriting module to encourage our students to share and build on each other’s ideas.

**Drama**

In drama, students take on different perspectives and roles to build empathy. They work collaboratively in the process of script writing, staging and acting. As a result of their exposure to drama, students become more confident speakers and have a greater understanding of theater.

**Co-Curriculum**

In our co-curriculum programmes, students are exposed to other art forms like dance, percussion and theater. These experiences serve to deepen their appreciation for the arts and offer opportunities for class bonding.

**Rhythm _Masala_**

In our Rhythm _Masala_ enrichment programme, students learn to play different types of percussion instruments and work together as a class to put up a performance.

**ArtSynergy**

In addition, we have our bi-annual ARTSynergy concert which is a community arts concert put together by our performing arts groups, allowing them to showcase their talent and previous year’s SYF performance. The concert also includes segments performed by our alumni, allowing them to remain connected to the school.

**PLAY Programme**

Lastly, we have our PLAY programme which is a programme to bring students to local and international performances at our local theatres. At Lower Secondary, every student will be sent for at least one performance. At Upper Secondary, students can sign up for theatre performances that they are interested in. Below are some performances that we have attended in the past.
